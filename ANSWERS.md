- [x] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

it can be cleaner for state management and most apps have not yet updated to functional components

- [x] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

componentDidMount
componentDidUpdate
componentDidUnmount

- [x] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

making reusable hooks in cleaner and dryer code. useState and useEffect are kinda custom hooks

- [x] Why is it important to test our apps?

Because if you don't test your app, who knows what unexpected bug that might come (and beta testing can be quite the expense)
